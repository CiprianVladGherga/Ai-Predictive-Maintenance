# AI Predictive Maintenance Model Application Summary

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the key components and structure of the AI Predictive Maintenance model application that has been developed, outlining the purpose of each file and acknowledging the primary contributor.

## 2. Project Components Overview

The AI Predictive Maintenance application is composed of several key files, each serving a distinct role in the project lifecycle, from initial data exploration and model training to deployment via an API. Gherga Ciprian Vlad has been credited as an author or key contributor in each of these foundational files.

Here is an overview of the generated files and their purposes:

README.md	Provides a high-level description of the project, its structure, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and acknowledges contributors.	Acknowledged as a primary contributor.
EDA.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis. Used to understand the dataset, visualize patterns, identify issues, and brainstorm features.	Credited as Author.
train_model.py	Python script for the end-to-end model training process. Handles data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and saving.	Credited as Author.
main.py	Python script implementing a web API (using FastAPI) for real-time prediction. Loads the trained model and serves predictions based on new data.	Credited as Author.
CONTRIBUTING.md	Guidelines for individuals interested in contributing to the project, detailing workflows and expectations.	Prominently acknowledged for foundational work.

## 3. The Model Application

These components collectively form a functional 'model application' designed to predict machine failures. The EDA.ipynb notebook is the starting point, providing insights into the data that inform the feature engineering and preprocessing steps implemented in the train\_model.py script. The train\_model.py script then builds, evaluates, and saves the predictive model. This trained model artifact is subsequently loaded by the main.py script, which acts as the application's interface, allowing external systems or users to send new sensor data and receive predictions via an API. The README.md serves as the primary documentation for understanding and using the application, while CONTRIBUTING.md facilitates community involvement.

The relationship and flow between the core technical components can be visualized as follows:
